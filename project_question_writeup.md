My project relates to my work for Apex Learning, an online school for high school students.

What is the question you hope to answer?
* Can we predict student success based on how a student progressed through a course?

What data are you planning to use to answer that question?
* An enrollment report from my company; each row in the report represents an enrollment in a class.
* Students can enroll in multiple classes, so each row is not one student (a student can have multiple entries on the report, one for each class the student enrolled in).
* There are about 20,000 enrollments for each school year, and data is available for multiple years; there are about 140 columns of data in the report.

What do you know about the data so far?
* The response variable is student grade (or a range of grades) I will classify as "success."
* There are a number of factors on the spreadsheet that I'll explore as potential features, such as time spent working on the course, number of assignments not completed, and (the ability to calculate) the number of simultaneous enrollments a student is attempting in a given period.

Why did you choose this topic?
* As an online school, influencing student success is a high priority for my company.
* I started this job within the past month, and this topic gives me the opportunity to make a high impact quickly in my new role.
